# Credit_Card_Default_Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of credit default behavior  using Python and common data analytics tools. It is beginner-level and intended to build foundational skills in data analytics and storytelling.

## Project Overview
The dataset contains client data from a financial institution, including features such as credit limit , education level, sex, age, maritul status, repayment history, and default status.

The goal of this project was to:
- Explore the relationship between customer attributes and likelihood of default
- Visualize patterns and trendsin repayment behavior
- Practice using pandas, matlpotlib, seaborn and basic manipulation
- Prepare for predictive modeling step

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn

## Files included
- `credit_default_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook woth full analysis, visualizations, and insights
- `README.md` Project overview and description

## Key Insights
- Clients with lower credit limits showed higher chances of defaulting.
- Males had a slightly higher default rate compared to females.
- People marked as "Other" or "Unknown" in categories like marriage and education had unusual default patterns (possibly worth deeper investigation).
- Payment history (especially delayed payments) is strongly linked to whether someone defaults or not.

## Next steps
Now that I’ve done the analysis, the next step is to build a simple predictive model — just to see if we can guess who might default based on what we’ve learned. I plan to start with something like logistic regression or a decision tree.

I’m sharing this as part of my learning journey, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come already. I know there’s still lots to learn!

## Open to Feedback!
If you are reading this and you are more advanced/exprenced - or even just curious - I’d love any feedback or ideas you might have. Feel free to open an issue or just say hi!
